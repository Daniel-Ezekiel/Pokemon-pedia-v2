## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Pokémon API

This is the second version of this project. Version 1 can be previewed using the links above. The major improvement with this version is that Pokémon are generated on page load at random. Also this current version has a better performance compared to its predecessor. A setTimeout that prevents the modal for some of the card from displaying was taken out and as soon as each card is rendered, it has the ability to create it's own popup with more info on that Pokémon.

This project was built using HTML as the base structure with CSS for the styling. Postman (https://www.postman.com/) was used to test the Pokemon API before it was implemented with the JavaScript. Based on the data obtained from the API, DOM manipulation was carried out to change and display data obtained within the DOM.

## Optimizations

Based on the optimizations suggested for version 1, now the app displays a notification that informs the user whether a Pokémon exists or not in the database.

## Lessons Learned:

With this project, my knowledge and command of the use of APIs has become more solid, as well as with creating new elements and populating the DOM as necessary. Also, I have improved in code debugging and performance improvement.
